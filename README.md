# CS215WebDatabase

The purpose of this repo is to conserver the working process on a university assignment. The CS215 class is about Web and Database Programming. There will be 6 assignment all along the semester, beginning with pure HTML/CSS programming to design and implement a meeting room booking site, then JavaScript to add form validation to the built website. Later on we will work on designing and implementing the database, further implementing the back-end programmingin PHP, and finally implementing AJAX-based information update.

### HTML and CSS

The HTML&CSS part is about implementing the core content of the website. Using [HTML5](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/html-essential-training/listening-for-an-event), but also respecting some syntax rules of XHTML alongside with [CSS3](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-essential-training-3/styling-documents-consistently), I implemented a welcome/main page, which is supposed to summarize what the website is about, then a sign-up, as well as a sign-in page and also a booking manangement page. I try to mainly use a [CSS grid-design](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-essential-training-3/introduction-to-css-grid) for positioning elements on the pages.
